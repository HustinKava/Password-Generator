<h2>Description</h2>

<p>For this homework assignment I was tasked in creating a password generator that utilizes the power of JavaScript! </p>

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>

<p>For this assignment I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript</p>

<h2>How it works</h2>

<p>The way this password generator works is very simple. You press the "Generate Password" button and will be greeted with a prompt. The prompt will ask you for the password length in numerical characters. Depending on what the user enters, does not enter or presses will all be taken into account. 

If the user meets the password length criteria they will be met with 4 confirms that they can pick from. The use of lower case letters, upper case letters, numbers and special characters. If the user clicks no on all four options they will be alerted that they must choose at least one option in order to generate the password. Once the criteria has been met, a password will generated in the text field.</p>

<h2>My Experience</h2>

<p>I found this homework very challenging and started from scratch multiple times. I was able to incorporate functions, if else statements, for loops, arrays, prompts, confirms and alerts.</p>
